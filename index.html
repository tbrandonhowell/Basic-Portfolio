                    Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. This is the fun part Let's build an almighty mountain. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. What the devil.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it. Give him a friend, we forget the trees get lonely too.
                </p>

                    This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. In this world, everything can be happy. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time.
